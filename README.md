# Mate Bit

Being interested in creative technology implementations and designs from early videogaming, the Mate Bit engine is the cumulation of all my research on the NES. It's not an emulator, but rather a modern day game engine made with the limitations the NES had with regards to graphics, audio, and input.

Development of this engine ran over the year of 2017 and it is no longer being worked on. It has been uploaded to github to be archived for peoples viewing pleasure.
